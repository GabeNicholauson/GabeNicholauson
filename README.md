Hello world, I am Gabriel Nicholauson, a software development student at MITT in Winnipeg, Canada. 

I haven't been coding for a long time, so im still a beginner, however I am very passionate about computers and how everything inside them functions. I can't wait to share some of my projects and improve my skills so that one day I can become a full time software developer.

I have experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I hope to broaden my experience and learn even more in the future.
